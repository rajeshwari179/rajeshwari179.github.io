2:T56d,This project focuses on the modeling and optimization of variable-geometry aircraft, specifically exploring the dynamic adjustment of wing sweep angle, twist angle, and chord length to adapt to varying flight conditions such as pitch, altitude, and velocity. Using Dymos simulation software, our work defines parameters, path constraints, and boundaries to accurately capture aircraft behavior. The primary parameters include wing surface area, specific impulse, and throttle, while path constraints regulate altitude and Mach number to maintain realistic flight trajectories. Our experiments each aim to optimize one of two objective functions: minimization of flight time and maximization of fuel efficiency. Through comprehensive simulations across climb, descent, and cruise flight phases, we compare the performance of variable and fixed-geometry aircraft models. Results indicate that variable-geometry aircraft consistently outperform fixed-geometry counterparts in terms of both airtime and fuel efficiency. This underscores the adaptability and optimality of variable-geometry designs while highlighting the challenges associated with achieving comparable performance with fixed-geometry configurations. These findings emphasize the potential benefits of variable-geometry aircraft in adapting to diverse flight conditions, achieving optimal performance across various objectives.0:["kYGLtbsdJaLLz7D90c5D-",[[["",{"children":["project",{"children":["5",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["project",{"children":["5",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"style":{"border":"2px solid #000","padding":"20px","borderRadius":"10px"},"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Variable-Geometry Aircraft Modelling and Simulation"}],[["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_box__pk1Aa","children":[["$","div",null,{"style":{"flex":1},"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_descriptionContainer__g40_B","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"Introduction"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_projectDescription__RSofK","children":["$2",["$","ul",null,{"children":[["$","li",null,{"children":"To enhance the performance of the particle simulation, parallel computing techniques using OpenMP and CUDA are employed."}],["$","li",null,{"children":" OpenMP allows for efficient distribution of the workload across multiple CPU threads, while CUDA enables offloading computations to the GPU, leveraging its massively parallel architecture.

For example, the fixed-geometry aircraft is able to fly the climb mission but is unable to meet the cruise and descent mission constraints. This is more apparent for cruise, where flying supersonically is impossible for the given configu- ration. This is likely due to the low value of the sweep angle, as typical supersonic configuration have sweep angles above 60 degrees.
