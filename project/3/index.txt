2:T589,Unsupervised clustering seeks to identify meaningful groups in data based on distances within a representation space. However, the initial overlap of distinct categories in the representation space presents a considerable challenge for achieving clear separation in distance-based clustering. Unsupervised learning faces a fundamental challenge in clustering, a topic extensively explored for many years. Traditional clustering methods like K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models rely on distance metrics in the data space, proving less effective for high-dimensional data. Our class discussions highlighted the sensitivity of K-means to initial centroids, as depicted in Figure 1, where it struggles to cluster accurately. In contrast, there is a growing interest in leveraging deep neural networks to map data into a lower-dimensional, more distinguishable representation space. To address these challenges, we introduce Supporting Clustering with Contrastive Learning (SCCL), a novel approach that optimizes both top-down clustering loss and bottom-up instance- wise contrastive loss concurrently. Our evaluation focuses on the increasingly crucial task of short text clustering. Through detailed analysis, we illustrate how SCCL successfully combines top-down clustering with bottom-up instance-wise contrastive learning, resulting in improved inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances. Figure 1: Failure of K-means.4:T4a7,CL, we monitor both intra- cluster distance and inter-cluster distance in the representation space throughout the learning process. In the context of a specific cluster, intra-cluster distance refers to the average distance between the centroid and all samples within that cluster, while inter-cluster distance is the distance to the nearest neighboring cluster. In Figure, we present each distance type along with its mean value obtained by averaging across all clusters. Clusters are defined either based on ground truth labels (solid line). Figure 3 illustrates that Clustering achieves a smaller intra-cluster distance and a larger inter-cluster distance when evaluated on predicted clusters. This highlights Clustering's capability to tighten each self-learned cluster and separate different clusters effectively. However, when evaluated on ground truth clusters, along with poor Accuracy and NMI scores, we observe the opposite trend. One possible explanation is that data from different ground-truth clusters often exhibit significant overlap in the embedding space before clustering begins making it challenging for our distance-based clustering approach to effectively separate them0:["wI3TYblLbLRiMrfxRdXDh",[[["",{"children":["project",{"children":["3",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["project",{"children":["3",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"style":{"border":"2px solid #000","padding":"20px","borderRadius":"10px"},"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Clustering with Contrastive Learning"}],[["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_box__pk1Aa","children":[["$","div",null,{"style":{"flex":1},"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_descriptionContainer__g40_B","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"Introduction"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_projectDescription__RSofK","children":["$2",["$","ul",null,{"children":["$","li",null,{"children":"This project is the implemenetation of the paper \"Supporting Clustering with Contrastive Learning\""}]}]]}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageSection__fIgKC","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageContainer__Xmpvw","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_customImage__wSvfz","children":["$","$L3",null,{"src":{"src":"/rajeshwari179.github.io//_next/static/media/sccl1.efe3e256.png","height":726,"width":1424,"blurDataURL":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAgAAAAECAIAAAA8r+mnAAAAWklEQVR42gUAWxJAILD7384nhg8zSpQe2/baimG9kfYSABq1Usi9GEKiRkwF4Peht7lSjBCkfKSyBTLjl1mmk6sVs0XNhd2FP7OJjGrx6F2CPr6K0Tgt8Blj/K1IWm/u9S/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","blurWidth":8,"blurHeight":4},"alt":"Project Introduction","layout":"fill"}]}]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageDescription__B6C1V","children":"Figure 1:TSNE visualization of the embedding space learned on SearchSnippets"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_box__pk1Aa","children":[["$","div",null,{"style":{"flex":1},"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_descriptionContainer__g40_B","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"Experimental Setup"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_projectDescription__RSofK","children":["We aim at developing a joint model that leverages the beneficial properties of Instance-CL to improve unsupervised clustering.
