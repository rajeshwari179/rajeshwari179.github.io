2:T51e,In this project, we aimed to implement a parallel algorithm for maintaining core numbers in dynamic graphs. Core numbers are important indicators of graph cohesion. Our investigation reveals a structure called the superior edge set, where edge insertions can be processed concurrently. Superior edge set is an important component of our algorithm. We explore parallelism in the core update process, particularly in simul- taneous multiple edge and vertex insertions. We demonstrate the efficiency of parallel algorithms and show their scalability through experiments on graphs of various density. We achieve speedups on existing serial and parallel implementations using multithreading on OpenMP and vectorization. Compared to sequential methods, our algorithm achieves significant speedup in processing time for edge and vertex insertions. we propose an efficient algorithm for in- cremental core maintenance. We introduce the concept of a superior edge set, where inserting such edges can change every vertex’s core number by at most 1. By identifying vertices affected by the insertion of each edge in parallel and updating their core numbers accordingly, we can maintain vertex core numbers efficiently. Our algorithm iteratively handles the insertions of split superior edge sets to achieve parallelism.4:T88e, This project aimed to implement a parallel algorithm for maintaining core numbers in dynamic graphs. Core numbers are important indicators of graph cohesion. Our investigation reveals a structure called the superior edge set, where edge insertions can be processed concurrently.

We achieve speedups on existing serial and parallel implementations using multithreading on OpenMP and vectorization. Compared to sequential methods, our algorithm achieves significant speedup in processing time for edge and vertex insertions. worked on an algorithm to identify superior edges andcompute changes in core numbers. Here’s a brief overview. We developed an algorithm to identify superior edges and compute changes in core numbers in graphs, with our current implementation being serial. The process begins with generating graphs to test and evaluate the algorithms. In each iteration, the algorithm identifies a superior edge set from the inserted edges. For each k-superior edge set ( E_k ), another algorithm determines the set of vertices whose core numbers change. A critical aspect is the negative Depth-First Search (DFS), which is essential for core maintenance. Initially, we compute SD values for each vertex in the ExPath Tree of ( E_k ). Then, for each edge ( e_i = langle u_i, v_i angle ), we find vertices whose core numbers change due to its insertion. A positive DFS is conducted from the root vertex ( r ) in the K Path Tree rooted at ( r ). If a vertex ( v ) is found where its core number cannot increase, a negative DFS removes ( v ) and updates CSD values of other vertices with core number ( k ). After traversing the K Path Tree, vertices not removed have their core numbers increased by 1. For edge insertion, we implemented serial edge insertion and three algorithms for core maintenance: SuperiorEdgeInsert, Core Calculation Algorithm, and K-SuperiorInsert.0:["rw08EXohAM_7HdnG9emRL",[[["",{"children":["project",{"children":["2",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["project",{"children":["2",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"style":{"border":"2px solid #000","padding":"20px","borderRadius":"10px"},"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Core Maintenance in Dynamic Graphs"}],[["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_box__pk1Aa","children":[["$","div",null,{"style":{"flex":1},"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_descriptionContainer__g40_B","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"Introduction"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_projectDescription__RSofK","children":"$2"}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageSection__fIgKC","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageContainer__Xmpvw","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_customImage__wSvfz","children":["$","$L3",null,{"src":{"src":"/rajeshwari179.github.io//_next/static/media/kcores.351e221d.png","height":499,"width":660,"blurDataURL":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAgAAAAGCAMAAADJ2y/JAAAAP1BMVEX//////v/+/v79/f78/P37/P36+/z5+fv4+fz39/n29/r29vj19vr19fX29Pbz9Prx8/jw8fjo6fLi5O7b3uwdVkxYAAAAMElEQVR42hXJxwHAIAwAsYshVNPZf1ZAX6EO4asF3SAXaTbLYzAherUgkMbKvP47HB01AQwFs2E3AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","blurWidth":8,"blurHeight":6},"alt":"Project Introduction","layout":"fill"}]}]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageDescription__B6C1V","children":" Graph Visualization for Core Number Computation"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_box__pk1Aa","children":[["$","div",null,{"style":{"flex":1},"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_descriptionContainer__g40_B","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"Implementation"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_projectDescription__RSofK","children":"$4"}]]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageSection__fIgKC","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageContainer__Xmpvw","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_customImage__wSvfz","children":["$","$L3",null,{"src":{"src":"/rajeshwari179.github.io//_next/static/media/table.830db99c.png","height":547,"width":1111,"blurDataURL":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAgAAAAECAIAAAA8r+mnAAAAVElEQVR42hXJsRGAMAwDQCk4AfYfiCUo6KmpOeLYArq/e57bAchjzNaGD0EZyanYtZ/96SLWtlSrkUGQtViFiZkQA1LiI/4y9By3ezibirXvCAJ8AcW+LhvFZ6K7AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","blurWidth":8,"blurHeight":4},"alt":"Project Implementation","layout":"fill"}]}]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"ProjectTemplate_imageDescription__B6C1V","children":"Parallel Implementation Results.

There is a steep increase in the run time between the last two graphs because the number of vertices increases from 54k to 200k as the edges double from 500k to 1M. Interestingly, there is a decrease in the run time as we go from 198k edges to 223k edges in the table(Musae-Wiki to Deezer-Hu).
